- **Enhanced with** - A powerful suite of custom features for advanced content management, workflow automation, and technical SEO.

## üöÄ Features

Surfing extends the AstroWind foundation with a focus on robust, automated, and SEO-driven content management.

### 1. Advanced Content Architecture

Four distinct, schema-driven content types, turning a simple blog into a multi-faceted knowledge base:

- **Articles**: For in-depth research, AI insights, and technical posts.
- **Showcase**: To feature project portfolios with live demos and source code links.
- **Documents**: For full HTML pages with custom CSS/JS, perfect for legacy content or interactive guides.
- **Cheatsheets**: A specialized format for AI-generated reference materials with metadata for topics, difficulty, and PDF downloads.

### 2. Automated Publishing Workflow (`postsurfing` CLI)

A powerful command-line tool that streamlines the entire publishing process from creation to deployment:

- **Smart Validation**: Validates frontmatter against predefined schemas for each content type.
- **Built-in SEO Checks**: Automatically warns against common SEO issues like missing descriptions, tags, or social sharing images before publishing.
- **HTML Conversion Engine**: Seamlessly converts full HTML files into Markdown, intelligently extracting and preserving inline/external CSS and JavaScript.
- **Build Verification**: Runs a production build before committing to prevent publishing errors.
- **Automated Git Integration**: Handles staging, committing (with smart messages), and pushing changes automatically.

### 3. Comprehensive Internationalization (i18n)

Built for a global audience with deep i18n support:

- **Multi-Language Content**: Maintain separate, organized content trees for each language (`en`, `zh`, `ja`).
- **Automated SEO for i18n**: Automatically generates `hreflang` tags to ensure search engines serve the correct language to users and prevent duplicate content issues.

### 4. Robust SEO & Content Discovery

Engineered for maximum visibility and discoverability:

- **Structured Data (Schema.org)**: Automatically generates JSON-LD for all content (e.g., `Article`, `WebSite`), enabling rich snippets in search results.

## üìù Content Publishing FAQs

### How do I publish content?

**Option 1: PostSurfing CLI (Recommended)**

Use our automated CLI tool for the best experience:

```bash
# Publish a markdown article
postsurfing ./my-article.md --type articles

# Convert and publish HTML document
postsurfing ./legacy-page.html --type documents --auto-convert

# Interactive mode for showcase projects
postsurfing ./project.md --type showcase --interactive

 # Publish AI-generated cheatsheet
 postsurfing ./javascript-cheatsheet.md --type cheatsheets

 # Publish HTML cheatsheet
 postsurfing ./cheatsheet.html --type cheatsheets --auto-convert
```

The CLI handles frontmatter validation, build testing, and git operations automatically.

### How do I publish HTML cheatsheets with PDF generation?

For AI-generated HTML cheatsheets that need PDF versions, we have a streamlined 4-step process:

```bash
# Step 1: Preprocess - Prepare working file in /tmp
./scripts/preprocess-cheatsheets.sh your-cheatsheet.html

# Step 2: Refine with AI assistant
# Use AI assistant with prompt: docs/prompt_cheatsheets.md
# The AI will refine content and layout in /tmp, then preview with Playwright

# Step 3: Review and approve
# Review the refined HTML in the browser preview

# Step 4: Publish - Convert and publish to website
# (Auto-generates PDF if not already present)
./scripts/postprocess-cheatsheets.sh /tmp/cheatsheets-working/your-cheatsheet.html
```

**What each step does:**

**Step 1 - Preprocess:**

- ‚úÖ Analyzes HTML structure and content
- ‚úÖ Generates processing configuration
- ‚úÖ Copies input file to `/tmp/cheatsheets-working/`
- ‚úÖ Provides AI assistant instructions with full /tmp path

**Step 2 - AI Refinement:**

- ‚úÖ Refines content quality and accuracy in /tmp
- ‚úÖ Optimizes layout and column balancing
- ‚úÖ Removes navigation elements
- ‚úÖ Previews with Playwright for approval

**Step 3 - User Review:**

- ‚úÖ Review refined HTML in browser
- ‚úÖ Approve or iterate back to Step 2

**Step 4 - Postprocess:**

- ‚úÖ Validates refined HTML
- ‚úÖ Auto-generates PDF if not present
- ‚úÖ Converts HTML to markdown with postsurfing:
  - Extracts external CSS/JS URLs ‚Üí `externalCSS`, `externalJS` arrays
  - Extracts inline styles ‚Üí `customCSS` frontmatter
  - Extracts inline scripts ‚Üí `customJS` frontmatter
  - Extracts body content ‚Üí markdown body
- ‚úÖ Publishes to `src/content/cheatsheets/en/*.md`
- ‚úÖ Cleans up temporary /tmp file
- ‚úÖ Commits and publishes to website

**Key improvements:**

- üö´ No permission interruptions (AI doesn't call external commands)
- ‚úÖ User reviews before publishing
- ‚úÖ Auto PDF generation (only if not already present)
- ‚úÖ Separate working directory (/tmp) prevents accidental overwrites
- ‚úÖ External libraries (CDN) preserved via `externalCSS`/`externalJS`
- ‚úÖ Custom styles preserved via `customCSS`/`customJS`
- ‚úÖ Site navigation integrated via `ExternalPageLayout`
- ‚úÖ SEO-friendly markdown format with full styling support

**Option 2: Manual Publishing**

1. Create your file in the appropriate directory:
   - Articles: `src/content/articles/your-article.md`
   - Showcase: `src/content/showcase/your-project.md`
   - Documents: `src/content/documents/your-document.md`
   - Cheatsheets: `src/content/cheatsheets/your-cheatsheet.md`

2. Add frontmatter and content
3. Commit to git

### What content formats are supported?

- **Markdown**: Standard markdown with frontmatter
- **HTML**: Full HTML documents with custom CSS/JS
- **Obsidian**: Native support for Obsidian markdown files
- **Mixed**: HTML content within markdown files
- **AI-Enhanced**: Cheatsheets with AI metadata, PDF attachments, and difficulty levels

### How do I migrate existing HTML content?

The PostSurfing CLI automatically converts HTML files and extracts external resources:

```bash
# Auto-convert HTML to Surfing format (for documents)
postsurfing ./existing-page.html --type documents --auto-convert

# What gets extracted:
# - External CSS: <link rel="stylesheet"> ‚Üí externalCSS array
# - External JS: <script src="..."> ‚Üí externalJS array
# - Inline CSS: <style> ‚Üí customCSS frontmatter
# - Inline JS: <script> ‚Üí customJS frontmatter
# - Body content ‚Üí markdown body
```

The resulting markdown will use `ExternalPageLayout` which:

- ‚úÖ Loads external libraries from CDN
- ‚úÖ Injects custom styles and scripts
- ‚úÖ Integrates with site navigation
- ‚úÖ Preserves original layout and functionality

Or see our [Content Specification Guide](./docs/content-specification.md) for manual migration steps.

### How do I unpublish content?

1. **Draft mode**: Add `draft: true` to frontmatter
2. **Delete**: Remove the file from `src/content/`
3. **Archive**: Move file outside content directories
