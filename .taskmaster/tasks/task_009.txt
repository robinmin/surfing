# Task ID: 9
# Title: Integrate Authentication into Site Header
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Add authentication component to the existing site header navigation
# Details:
Modify src/components/widgets/Header.astro to include the AuthContainer component in the top-right area. Position it alongside existing elements (theme toggle, language selector, RSS feed). Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and responsive behavior. The authentication UI should be non-intrusive and not interfere with existing navigation functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test header layout on different screen sizes, verify authentication UI integrates well with existing elements, and ensure no layout conflicts
