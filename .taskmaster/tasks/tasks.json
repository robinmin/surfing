Add className prop for custom styling and containerClass for wrapper customization. Include onClick handler prop for external popup menu integration.

            "details": "- Create src/lib/token-guardian.ts with cache logic\n- Store last validation timestamp in localStorage\n- Implement 15-minute cache duration (configurable)\n- Check if current time < (last_validation + duration)\n- Validate token expiry even within cache duration\n- Auto-refresh token using Supabase built-in mechanism\n- Handle edge cases (expired tokens, clock skew)\n<info added on 2025-10-04T22:50:38.030Z>\nI'll analyze the codebase to understand the current structure and configuration patterns before updating the subtask details.Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see that the project uses a custom integration system that loads configuration from `src/config.yaml` and makes it available through a virtual module. The auth section is already defined in the config file. Here's the update for the token guardian implementation:\n\nAdd auth.token_cache_duration configuration property to src/config.yaml (default: 900 seconds). Update token-guardian.ts to import configuration using the project's virtual module system (astrowind:config) and read cache duration from config.auth.token_cache_duration instead of hardcoding 15 minutes. This aligns with existing project patterns where auth configuration is centralized in config.yaml and accessed through the integration's virtual module resolver.\n</info added on 2025-10-04T22:50:38.030Z>",

Focus test implementation on: 1) Cache hit/miss timing verification with precise duration window testing, 2) Token expiry detection even when cache appears valid, 3) localStorage state handling (enabled/disabled browser settings, storage quota exceeded scenarios), 4) Edge cases including browser clock skew and invalid token formats. Use existing test infrastructure following patterns in tests/postsurfing/ directory structure. Mock Supabase auth.getSession() and auth.refreshSession() calls rather than actual network requests. Reference src/lib/auth.ts authManager implementation for session handling patterns. Defer comprehensive UI state transition testing to future iterations.\n</info added on 2025-10-04T22:53:02.380Z>",
