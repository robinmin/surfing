# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement SHA-256 Hashing Utility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create utility function for SHA-256 hashing required for Google One Tap nonce verification
# Details:
Create src/utils/crypto.ts with sha256Hash function that uses Web Crypto API to generate SHA-256 hashes. This is required for Google One Tap nonce verification where the raw nonce is sent to Supabase but a hashed version is sent to Google. Include proper error handling and browser compatibility checks.

# Test Strategy:
Test function with known input/output pairs to verify correct SHA-256 hash generation
